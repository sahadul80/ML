Mount Google Drive:
Add the following code snippet at the beginning of your notebook to mount your Google Drive:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Run the Provided Code:
Copy and paste the provided code into separate cells in your notebook.
Ensure the file paths (train_file_path and test_file_path) match the location of your data files in Google Drive.
Run each cell to execute the code step by step.
Verify Results:
After running the code, verify that the results are as expected.
Check the printed model parameters, RMSE, costs, and any generated plots to ensure they align with your expectations.
By following these instructions, you should be able to run the code successfully in Google Colab and analyze the results for the multiple regression exercise.
